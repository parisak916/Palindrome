# Palindrome
Checks if a word is palindrome ( a word that reads same reversed) using stacks and queues. The program asks the user for input, and checks if the word is palindrome by inserting into the stack and queue and checking if each pop and dequeue are the same. 
Can be used with other types (ints, doubles, strings, etc). The queue, stack, and nodes are written with generics.
